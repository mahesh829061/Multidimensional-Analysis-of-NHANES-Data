# NHANES-Multidimensional-Analysis


The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. The survey is unique in that it combines interviews and physical examinations. The survey examines a nationally representative sample of about 5,000 persons each year. These persons are located in counties across the country, 15 of which are visited each year.
The NHANES interview includes demographic, socioeconomic, dietary, and health-related questions. The examination component consists of medical, dental, and physiological measurements, as well as laboratory tests administered by highly trained medical personnel.
We will take some of this dataset to understand how we analyze high-dimensional data. This dataset has more than 200 features and we will put in action PCA and some clustering techniques to visualize insights from the dataset.

For this task, we will be working with the following datasets:
1) Examinations dataset.
2) Dietary dataset.
3) Laboratory dataset.

I have uploaded all the three datasets separately.
The Data preparation.ipynb file combines these three datasets into one and cleans and scales the data.
After our dataset is inally ready, I exported it to data.csv.
(It was a big file so I have uploaded it's compressed version. Use 7zip to decompress the file.)

This data.csv was finally used on our model in Analysis-and-Model.ipynb file.
